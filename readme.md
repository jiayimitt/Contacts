# MyContact 

A simple contact management application that allows users to add, view, and delete contacts. This project validates the input for each contact (name, city, and email) and prevents duplicate contacts from being added.

## Features

- **Add New Contacts**: Users can add a contact by inputting the name, city, and email in a comma-separated format.
- **Validation**:
  - **Name**: Only letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes are allowed.
  - **City**: Only letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes are allowed.
  - **Email**: Valid email format (e.g., user@example.com) is required.
- **Duplicate Contact Check**: The app checks if a contact with the same name, city, and email already exists before adding it.
- **View Contacts**: Displays a list of all saved contacts with their name, city, and email.
- **Delete Contacts**: Contacts can be deleted by clicking on their respective contact cards.
- **Contact Count**: The number of saved contacts is displayed at the top of the contact list.
